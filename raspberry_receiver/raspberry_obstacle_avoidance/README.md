# RB5 Obstacle Avoidance – ROS2 Direct Publishers

These nodes are the **same as those in the `rb5_obstacle_avoidance` folder**,  
with the difference that they **can publish motor commands directly on the Raspberry Pi** instead of using UDP.

> ⚠️ **Note:** Direct usage on a Raspberry Pi **is not recommended**,  
> because it can put a significant computational load on the device.
